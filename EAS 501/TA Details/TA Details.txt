NOTE ignore this if you saw it before. I didn't have access to all the students on UB learns, now that's been fixed.

Hello everyone,

My name is luke and I'm your TA this semester for Numerical Mathematics for Data Scientists (EAS501). I have office hours Tuesday 11 am - 2pm and Thursday 1 pm - 4 pm in Furnas 805. This is a great time to come ask questions about homework, programing problems, the course in general, or whatever. There are 6 hours a week of office hours so please come and ask questions about assignments before they are due. I look forward to meeting you all and have a great semester!

luke
